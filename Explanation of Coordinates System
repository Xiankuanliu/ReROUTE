The coordinate system we are using is rather unconventional in that it is one dimensional.

We made this decision for a few reasons:

i) Trains follow a single path so we only need a one dimensional value to store any trains location
ii) Extra data only complicates calculations etc. while adding very little in terms of actual benefits (for our purposes)
ii) Having a single value rather than a 2d vector makes locating trains on the track simpler
iv) Potential off track errors where the horizontal location of a train is incorrect are avoided

So what does this system look like for Toronto's Line 1 Subway?

Since this line is 30.2 km long we define all positions pos as being in the range -30200 <= pos < 30200.
~We use 30200 (the meters) for improved granularity needed to accurately simulate train movements. 
~The "end" of the line (in this case corresponding to Sheppard West Station) is located at pos = -30200, when any train reaches pos = 30200 they are instantly relocated to pos = -30200
~Downsview Depot conviniently locates at pos = -30200
~Since the line is 30.2 km on one pass from Sheppard West to Finch (the other terminus) our coordinate system actually covers double
the possible range for one direction along the line, hence we let the negative coordinates refer to trains travelling on the track from
(SHEPPARD WEST -> FINCH) and positive coordinates refer to trains travelling on the track back (FINCH -> SHEPPARD WEST)
~This assumes Finch station is located at coordinate pos = 0
